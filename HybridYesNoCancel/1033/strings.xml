This gadget shows how to use hybrid gadgets. A hybrid gadget consists of a JavaScript main, but also includes precompiled native code. This can be useful for advanced functionality of a computer. In this sample, we are using the Windows API MessageBox to show a message box that has three buttons: Yes, No and Cancel. The result is returned as a string from the native code and displayed in JavaScript.</GADGET_ABOUT>
