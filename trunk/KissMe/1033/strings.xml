  <GADGET_ABOUT_TEXT>Kiss Me!
© 2007 Kathy Walrath
Keep a kissable picture of your sweetheart on your desktop.

First add your sweetie's image by dragging a PNG, JPEG, GIF, or TIFF file into the golden frame.

Then whenever you feel the need, kiss your sweetie by clicking the image!

This gadget works best with an image that's 100 pixels wide and 120 pixels tall, or that has a similar width-to-height ratio.

The kissing sound was created by roscoetoon and downloaded from Freesound.

This gadget's built-in images were created by my sweetie, Nathan Walrath.
