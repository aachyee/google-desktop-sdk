© 2007 Google Inc. All Rights Reserved
Keep a kissable picture of your sweetheart on your desktop.

First add your sweetie's image by dragging a PNG, JPEG, GIF, or TIFF file into the golden frame.

Then whenever you feel the need, kiss your sweetie by clicking the image!

This gadget works best with an image that's 100 pixels wide and 120 pixels tall, or that has a similar width-to-height ratio.
